# ComplEXIT_DoC
Repolsory of all the analysis done about brain complexity for the project "ComplEXIT_DoC". The aim of the project is to investigate the use of psychedelics (ketamine and psilocybin) for the treatment of patients with post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC).

For the moment, we will include here other scripts used for calculate or analyze complexity in the lab.
